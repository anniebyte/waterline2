# Waterline 2.0

> rewrite

## Goals

+ Better support client-side usage and relevant requirements:
  + Lightweight
  + Fewer dependencies (but holy shit we have to keep lodash)
+ Conform to/establish a standard that can be used in other languages.
+ Improve nomenclature / overloaded terminology.

> TODO: expand this section

## Timeline

We'll see how this goes.  Who knows?  Maybe early-mid 2015 or maybe never- depends.  But I wanted to jot down the ideas now rather than letting them fester.
